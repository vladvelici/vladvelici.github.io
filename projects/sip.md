2011

SIP stands for _*S*istem de *I*nformare a *P*ărinților_ (romanian for System for Informing the Parents). Simply, it was a School Management System where teachers could input and manage marks, absences, timetables and students.

Written in PHP using YiiFramework.

Parents could also login to the platform to see the marks of their children and how they're doing. The idea for this is to improve teacher-parent communication.

It had SMS alerts and e-mail alerts, and teachers could directly send a message to parents or to a whole class.

### Why it didn't take off

Had the wrong business model, and didn't realise it. It started with the assumption that parents are desperate to have these SMS alerts, and build the whole business model around the cost of a fairly large volume of texts. E-mail notifications weren't really an option given the tech-savvy-ness of target users.

Also replacing the paperwork wasn't an option for bureaucratic reasons. Thus inputting data into the system was a pain and a double effort. Perhaps the value of having parents always up to date wasn't worth the constant time investment for teachers.
