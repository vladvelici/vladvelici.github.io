      <description>I have this tendency of working on many things at once, and as a result I don&amp;rsquo;t really finish anything, I just make small progress until I switch context to start working on something else.
This really kills my productivity. It seems obvious now but when I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project and start feeling pressured by not working on a different project, it&amp;rsquo;s not so obvious that I&amp;rsquo;m not getting either of them done.</description>
