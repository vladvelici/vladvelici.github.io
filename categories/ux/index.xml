      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve logged into Twitter today. This was the flow:
Refuse cookies. Scroll down, find login button. The page is full of options to sign up. Being asked to type some login information, but not username and password. Just the ID first. Safari autocomplete is handy - I use it to fill in my username, asks for Touch ID (since it attempts to fill password as well) Page changes, now the username is written and I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to type a password, so I have to autocomplete again (and use Touch ID again).</description>

      <description>Things to consider if you’re thinking to build a chatbot-only service or website.
Quick notice: I don’t build chatbots and don’t use too many, but I haven’t been impressed with the ones I’ve seen. In no way this is definitive advice on things to consider when building conversational interfaces, this is just my opinion on the topic.
I’ve seen a few websites that welcome you with a full-screen chatbot and no option to not interact with it.</description>
