      <description>For first, a Hackathon is a competition where hackers get together to build something cool. Lots of times designers and business people also join and the judging also takes the business side into consideration. Usually justifying how the idea is useful and/or generating revenue and showing some proof that people want it is enough. A hackathon generally takes a weekend. Some are three days, some are two days long. Almost always the venue is open overnight and sleeping is replaced by caffeine.</description>
