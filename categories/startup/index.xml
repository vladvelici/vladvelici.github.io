      <description>I’ve been generating bad business ideas for a while. Ideas that sounded kind of OK at first, but when digging a little deeper it was nothing there. On Derek Sivers’ idea multiplier, those would be at the -1 point (awful).
After some time I’ve noticed that those ideas were repetitive, and I would come up with the same idea (or something extremely similar) all over again, just like it was a new idea altogether.</description>
