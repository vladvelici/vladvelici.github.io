      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to write three things you are grateful for every day. It keeps you focus on the positive. I have this idea from this TED talk. I did it for more than a month some time ago and I&amp;rsquo;m now restarting this habit.
It happened that I&amp;rsquo;ve received a small notebook as a freebie form some event just before starting this habit thus I was OK with writing three things I was grateful for every day on paper.</description>
